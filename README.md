"# RNA-Seq-Analysis-using-R-part-1-and-2" 
I will like to appreciate TOG of BCCHR for provisiding necessary raw data, workshop and tutorial that make this work posible.

Part 1 - RNA-seq:  Raw to Processed Data (from Bam file)
Raw expression count matrix, visualize, filter, quality control and normalize the data.

Part 2 - RNA-seq: From differential gene analysis and gene-pathway enrichment
Processed counts data, principle component analysis, differential expression, and gene and pathway analysis.
